Project 4
Plan of Attack


    This project will require an almost complete rework of my previous command line parser, changes to my Appointment
and AppointmentBook classes to better work with the REST client and servlet. The Appointment class was augmented to take
Date objects in its constructor when building new Appointments. This is later used within the AppointmentBook class to
get a Sorted set of Appointments within a Supplied as part of the GET functionality of the AppointmentServlet.

    If an AppointmentBook is not found the servlet responds with a message indicating a book was not found for the
owner supplied. It then prints a list of known/managed AppointmentBooks by owner. To protect against concurrency issues
that could arise via a web server, I chose to store all of the AppointmentBooks in ConcurrentHashMap object from the
Java Collections framework.
